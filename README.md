#### A React Quiz Application

During our class we created a React application which contains 5 questions and multiple choice answers.

The main components are:
- Question;
- Answer;
- Progress Bar;
- Submit button.

#### Challenge

1. Finish retry functionality
2. Create css and test files for each component
3. Create a file structure based on components e.g. App folder holds App.js, App.css, App.test.js
4. Create styling for your quiz app
5. In your new test files, run the basic test from App.test.js. Make sure they all pass

#### Solution

1. After all the questions have been answered a user have a possibility to see the score and retry the test;
2. We created all the test and .css files for all the components;
3. All the files are sorted into their respective folders;
4. We implemented Bootstrap;
5. We run all the basic tests and all of them passed.

#### Difficulties encountered
